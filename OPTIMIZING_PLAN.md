1. **Inefficient Database Connection Strategy:**
   - The `connectToDatabase()` function in `lib/mongodb.ts` creates a new connection for each API request instead of properly reusing connections.
   - MongoDB Atlas connection is happening without proper connection pooling optimization.

2. **No Timeout Handling:**
   - Database queries lack proper timeout settings, so when MongoDB Atlas is slow to respond, the application hangs.

3. **Multiple Connection Patterns:**
   - The project uses inconsistent database connection patterns - some files use `connectToDatabase()` while others use `dbManager.connect()`.

4. **Missing Indexes:**
   - The StudyOffer model has many fields but may be missing proper indexes for common query patterns.

5. **Inefficient Caching Strategy:**
   - The caching implementation uses an in-memory cache which is cleared on each server restart and not shared across serverless functions.

6. **Validation Overhead:**
   - Mongoose models have extensive validation that runs on each query, adding overhead.

7. **Complex Query Construction:**
   - The `useStudyOffers` hook builds complex query parameters that might result in inefficient MongoDB queries.

8. **Missing Connection Error Handling:**
   - Poor error handling for database connection failures.

Here's how to fix these issues:

1. **Optimize MongoDB Connection:**
   - Implement a proper connection pooling strategy
   - Add better timeout and retry logic
   - Unify the connection pattern across the application

2. **Implement Better Caching:**
   - Use a distributed cache solution (Redis) instead of in-memory cache
   - Add cache warming for frequently accessed data
   - Increase cache TTL for data that changes infrequently

3. **Optimize Queries:**
   - Review and optimize MongoDB indexes
   - Simplify query structure
   - Use projection to limit returned fields

4. **Add Proper Loading States:**
   - Implement progressive loading patterns
   - Show partial content while waiting for complete data
   - Implement better skeleton loading components

5. **Improve Error Handling:**
   - Add timeout handling for MongoDB operations
   - Implement graceful degradation when database is slow
   - Add proper fallback UI for error states

This should significantly improve the loading performance and user experience when fetching data from MongoDB Atlas.
